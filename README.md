# SimpleSocialNetwork
This is a simple social network designed with Django REST framework and ReactJS. It is a dockerized application so should be possible to run it once migrations have been applied using `docker-compose up`.

The application will allow users to register, login, make posts, view profile pages of their friends, etc.
